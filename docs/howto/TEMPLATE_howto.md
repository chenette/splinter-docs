## Procedure

<!--
Always number the steps. You can use bullets within a step for lists of items
that don't have an order, such as optional values or settings.
-->

1. {First step} Begin with a verb: "Start the doohicky." or "Change the
   setting." or "Enable the thingummy option." or "Open a terminal window."
   (Describe the action or result instead of just saying "Run the `doohicky`
   command.") For a CLI command, follow with the command in a code block.

   NOTE: Put essential info BEFORE the example command (anything you must
   know before running the command or performing the action).

   ```
   doohicky start --thingummy
   ```

   Explain the results or the details AFTER the code block.

1. {Second step} Begin with a verb.

   a. {Ordered substep)

   b. {Ordered substep)

   c. {Ordered substep)


1. {Third step} Remember to start the sentence with a verb.

   To add a second paragraph under a step, indent the text.

1. {Fourth step} Start with a verb.
