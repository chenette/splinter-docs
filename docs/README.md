# About the splinter/docs directory

This directory contains the source files for the [Splinter
documentation](index.md).

Splinter documentation is written in
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM).
For a quick reference, see this
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
from [adam-p/markdown-here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here).

The documentation is organized as follows:

* ``index.md``: [Documentation home](index.md) (landing page with links
  to documentation contents).

* ``community/``: Topics that describe how to participate in the Splinter
  community and contribute to the Splinter repositories.

* ``concepts/``: Topics that explain Splinter concepts, architecture, features,
  and other non-procedure information. File names should reflect the topic
  title, using all lowercase and optional underscores between words; for
  example, ``circuits.md`` or ``state_delta_export.md``.

* ``faq/``: Splinter FAQ in one or more files. The main page, ``faq.md``,
  introduces the FAQ and contains the first few questions. Other files can be
  added as necessary to divide the FAQ into sections.

* ``glossary/``: Definitions of Splinter terms in the file ``glossary.md``.

* ``howto/``: Procedures for specific tasks (such as configuring Splinter,
  setting permissions, using a feature, or running example demos). File names
  should be verb phrases that reflect the topic title, using all lowercase and
  optional underscores between words; for example, ``upgrading_splinter.md``
  or ``creating_the_node_registry.md``.

* ``images/``: Graphics, pictures, diagrams, icons and other images in the
  Splinter documentation. PNG format is preferred; GIF or JPG is allowed.
  (SVG files are not supported.)

* ``tutorials/``: In-depth, multi-section procedures for complex tasks, such as
  creating an application.

* ``upgrading/``: In-depth guides for upgrading from one version of Splinter
  to another version.
